## 🏁 Introduction

There are numerous algorithms that process a list of values. The purpose of this
algorithm all-hands assignment is to design, implement, test and then use in an
empirical study a tool that can automatically conduct doubling experiments to
measure the performance of an arbitrary list processing algorithm. The tool that
you implement, tentatively called `bosco`, should operate in a fashion that is
as general-purpose as is possible. This means that it should, whenever possible,
be able to automatically detect and invoke a list-processing function in a
provided Python source code file, determine the type of list that is input into
that function, and then generate data that is suitable for the purposes of
running a doubling experiment to identify its likely worst-case time complexity.

Ultimately, this algorithm all-hands assignment invites you to apply what you
learned in the algorithm analysis course, by implementing a benchmarking
framework that operates in the following fashion:

- Accept as input one or more Python source code files that contain one or more
functions that perform list processing. For the purposes of creating your
benchmarking framework you can assume that all list-processing algorithms will
implement some type of function that accepts as input a list and that it will be
this list whose contents are doubled during the execution of a doubling
experiment.
- Accept as input the fully-qualified name of a list-processing function that
should be subject to benchmarking through a doubling experiment.
- Accept as input the description of an input generation procedure that can
automatically generate data suitable for the purposes of conducting a doubling
experiment to evaluate the performance of the list-processing algorithm.
- Automatically extract the list-processing function from the provided Python
source code file(s) and then reflectively invoke the function to sort data that
was automatically generated.
- In a series of automatically completed benchmarking rounds, the tool should
conduct a doubling experiment by which it generates data sets of increasing size
and then uses them to evaluate the performance of the list-processing algorithm.
- The tool should produce diagnostic data that shows the execution time for each
round of the doubling experiment, a computed version of the doubling ratio based
on the collected data, and a statement about the likely worst-case time
complexity suggested by the doubling ratio.
- Your tool must be implemented with the Python programming language and use the
Poetry system for managing dependencies and packaging.
- Your tool must provide a command-line interface implemented through the use of
Typer and offer command-line arguments that fully support its configuration.
- Your tool can leverage Python source code that you previously implemented as a
part of a course project as long as you carefully document the source of any
Python code segments.

As you work to build and evaluate this system in a team-based fashion, please
keep in mind the following considerations and tasks:

- Organize your class, which comprises the team for this algorithm all-hands
project, into sub-teams organized around completing the following task:
    - **Infrastructure**: 
- Meet in your assigned groups to discuss how your team is going to design,
implement, test, and evaluate your benchmarking framework. Make sure that you
give your benchmarking framework a descriptive name that reflects its purpose.
- Discuss with your team members which GitHub repository you are going to use to
coordinate your work. As you make this decision, please bear in mind that the
final version of your framework will be transferred to the course's GitHub
organization and so that it may be considered for use in follow-on projects.
- Specify, design, and implement a benchmarking framework that supports the
experimental evaluation of any list-processing algorithm function that you and your team
members agree your benchmarking framework should support.
- Collect a group of list-processing algorithms and use them to conduct a series of
doubling experiments that experimentally evaluate their performance with the
ultimate goal of determining which algorithm is the fastest and characterizing
the likely time complexity of each algorithm.
- Write and publish on the course web site a blog post that explains (a) how you
designed and implemented your benchmarking framework, (b) the list-processing algorithm
functions that you chose to use in your doubling experiments, (c) the runtime
results from your experimental study with the benchmarking framework that you
implemented and (d) the running time results from an analytical evaluation that
you conducted. Your blog post should clearly articulate (a) whether or not the
experimental and analytical results for your function are in alignment with each
other, (b) what is most likely to be the realistic runtime and true running time
of a list-processing function, and (c) why you judge that your function has this runtime
and running time, (d) which list-processing algorithm function from among those selected
by your team members is the fastest, and (e) why this specific implementation
proved to be the fastest among all of the list-processing algorithms.
- Present your findings to the entire class during the following week of the
academic semester during the follow-on algorithm all-hands session.
- Please note that all of the work that you complete for this assignment should
be published to the course web site. Your team must create and contribute to a
pull request on the course web site's GitHub repository and ensure that your
work is reviewed, revised, and published in advance of the Friday class session
for next week. Importantly, your implementation of the benchmarking framework
and the list-processing algorithms should be available in one or more additional GitHub
repositories that are referenced in the blog post that you write.

It is important to point out that your repository for this project was created
from the GitHub repository template called
[list-list-processing-tools-starter](https://github.com/Algorithmology/list-sorting-tools-starter);
you can check this repository for any updates to this project's documentation or
source code! Finally, the teams and their corresponding functions will be
assigned through an announcement in Discord; check there for more details!

## 🤝 Seeking Assistance

Even though the course instructor will have covered all of the concepts central
to this project before you start to work on it, please note that not every
detail needed to successfully complete the assignment will have been covered
during prior classroom sessions. This is by design as an important skill that
you must practice as an algorithm engineer is to search for and then understand
and ultimately apply the technical content found in additional resources.
